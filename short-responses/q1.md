# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
Storing our API keys in the front end would allow users to access and steal the API key, so they could use the API on your behalf. This is incredibly dangerous as if you are paying for an API key, this malicious user could rack up charges on your card by requesting so much information from the database using the key that they stole from you. They would also be granted easy access to a lot of information they could easily misuse or abuse.
